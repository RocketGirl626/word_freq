Project
Create a website that uses a method to return how frequently a word appears in a given string. The user should be able
to input both the word and the string of words to check.

1)  Check to see if the word the user inputs is received

2)  Check to see if the phrase the user inputs is received

3)  Check that the word count is correctly counting the number of words in the phrase.
